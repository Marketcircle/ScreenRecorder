# Screen Recorder

A simple app to act as a proxy to the screen recording APIs in
AVFoundation. I would have done this in MacRuby, but AVFoundation does
not work with garbage collection on OS X 10.7.

There is not much to see here, but the goal will be a simple app, just
some menus, so that screen recordings can be easily started,
stopped, or paused.
